# id-heading-autolinker-extension

Chrome extension which enables auto-linking heading elements with `id` attribute

_Current Status: Requesting registering as chrome web store_

## Motivation

- When you see heading (e.g. `h2`, `h3`, `h4`) with `id` attribute, you would like to get its permalink
- Sometimes there is no link button over heading element
- This extension adds link along heading element automatically when you visit a page
